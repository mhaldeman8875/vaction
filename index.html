        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>As soon as we left the airport we found ourselves surrounded by a pack of feral dogs and had to sacrifice most of our food in order to escape them to our hostel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>Today, we accidentally wandered into a riot in the heart of Buenos Aires and almost got caught in the middle of an exchange of fire between a local milita and the federales. The militia was quickly overwhelmed and wiped out by what must be called a "death squad" at this point, given their military expertise.</p>

          <p>We were drunk and throwing bottles. One of the bottles hit the Montezuma family celebrating a birthday next door. In retaliation the forced laxatives down our throats. They were avenged.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>We took refuge from the Montezuma family by retreating into the mountains. Unfortunately we got lost and wound up wandering into a neighboring country. After days without any food and worsening dysentary we located a road and followed it to a town. We were quickly encarcerated until we were ruled out as illegal aliens.</p>
